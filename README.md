# Tactics Exploration

Hey! My favorite game of all time is Final Fantasy Tactics. I've always wanted to build a multiplayer version, and I don't have a job right now so why not!

## Setup

### Assets

This project uses `git-lfs` to track assets. You'll likely need to install `git-lfs` to get started.

### Building the project

This project is written in Rust! Use [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) to setup Rust.

From the root of the project, run `cargo build` which will take a fair bit of time on the first go, as it needs to compile all of bevy. 

After that, you should be able to run `cargo run` to run the project with a fair bit of speed.

### Testing the Project

`cargo test` is your friend!
